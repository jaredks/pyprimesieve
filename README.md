pyprimesieve
============

Many primes, very fast. Uses [primesieve][0].

primesieve, one of the fastest (if not the fastest) prime sieve implementaions available, is actively maintained by
Kim Walisch.

It uses a segmented sieve of Eratosthenes with wheel factorization for a complexity of `O(nloglogn)` operations.


Performance
-----------

Regarding primesieve for C++:

> primesieve generates the first 50,847,534 primes up to 10^9 in just 0.4 seconds on a single core of an Intel Core
> i7-920 2.66GHz, this is about 50 times faster than an ordinary C/C++ sieve of Eratosthenes implementation and about
> 10,000 times faster than trial-division. primesieve outperforms [Kim's] older [ecprime][1] (fastest from 2002 to 2010) by
> about 30 percent and also substantially outperforms [primegen][2] the fastest sieve of Atkin implementation on the
> web.

For comparison, on an Intel Core i7 2GHz, `pyprimesieve` populates an entire Python list of the first
50,847,534 primes in 1.40 seconds. It's expected that a Python implementation would be slower than C++ but,
surprisingly, by only one second.

`pyprimesieve` outperforms all of the fastest prime sieving implementations for Python.

    Time (ms) to generate the all primes below one million and iterate over them in Python:

    pyprimesieve         2.79903411865
    primesfrom2to        13.1568908691
    primesfrom3to        13.5800838470
    ambi_sieve           16.1600112915
    rwh_primes2          38.7749671936
    rwh_primes1          48.5658645630
    rwh_primes           52.0040988922
    sieve_wheel_30       59.3869686127
    sieveOfEratosthenes  59.4990253448
    ambi_sieve_plain     161.740064621
    sieveOfAtkin         232.724905014
    sundaram3            251.194953918

It can be seen here that `pyprimesieve` is *4.7 times faster* than the fastest Python alternative using `Numpy` and
*13.85 times faster* than the fastest pure Python sieve.

All benchmark scripts and algorithms are available for reproduction. Prime sieve algorithm implementations were taken
from [this discussion on SO][3].

Functions
---------

**primes(n)**: List of prime numbers up to `n`.

**primes(start, n)**: List of prime numbers from `start` up to `n`.

**primes_sum(n)**: The summation of prime numbers up to `n`. The optimal number of threads will be determined for the
given number and system.

**primes_sum(start, n)**: The summation of prime numbers from `start` up to `n`. The optimal number of threads will be
determined for the given numbers and system.

**primes_nth(n)**: The nth prime number.

**factorize(n)**: List of tuples in the form of (prime, power) for the prime factorization of `n`.


Installation
------------

    python setup.py install

NOTE: Because of the need to use OpenMP to compile the parallelized version of summation, g++ is specified in
environment variables of setup to avoid distutils choosing a compiler that does not have support for OpenMP. If you
don't have g++, you will need to change that in `setup.py`.

Like any C/C++ extension, you need to have the development package of Python (able to include `Python.h`) in order to
compile. On Ubuntu you can simply run,

    sudo apt-get install python-dev

After installation, you can make sure everything is working by running the following inside the project root folder,

    python tests
